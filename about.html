        <h2>Fullstack Developer</h2>
        <p>
          My continuing goal is to learn more in general.
          That is what pulled me towards development from the start and what keeps me interested in the subject, as
          there is never an end to the development of new languages, frameworks, or design patterns.
          I have as of yet only explored a miniscule part of the subject as a whole, and I am always looking for some
          new way to implement a solution to a problem.
          I function both in a group and as an independent worker, but preferably as a part of an agile team, implementing Scrum.
