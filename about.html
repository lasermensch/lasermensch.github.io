        <h2>Fullstack Developer</h2>
        <p>
          My continuing goal is to learn more in general.
          That is what pulled me towards development from the start and what keeps me interested in the subject, as
          there is never an end to the development of new languages, frameworks, or design patterns.
          I have as of yet only explored a miniscule part of the subject as a whole, and I am always looking for some
          new way to implement a solution to a problem.
          I function both in a group and as an independent worker, but preferably as a part of an agile team, implementing Scrum.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>I like learning new things and getting to know new people, focusing on the positive and solving the problems I might encounter.
          
          Personal growth is just as important to me as teamwork and, by sharing my
          
          experiences with others, I learn even more. My aim as a developer is to create an
          
          innovative, organized and meaningful code, while keeping it usable and
          
          enjoyable for the users.</p> -->
